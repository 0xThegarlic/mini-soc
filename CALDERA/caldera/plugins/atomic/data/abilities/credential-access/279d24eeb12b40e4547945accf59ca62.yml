- description: "Perform a domain password spray using the same core method of the\
    \ [DomainPasswordSpray tool](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray)\
    \ \nbut without all the extra code that makes the script get blocked by many AVs.\
    \ \nThis atomic test will attempt a single password against all users in a password\
    \ list at $env:Temp\\usersdpsLight.txt. You can create this file manually\nor\
    \ with the automated prereq_command. The prereq_command will limit the user list\
    \ to 200 users by default to help you avoid massive account lockout.\n"
