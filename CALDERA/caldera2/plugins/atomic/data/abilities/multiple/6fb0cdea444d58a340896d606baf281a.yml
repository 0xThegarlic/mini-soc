- description: 'The following Atomic will create a New-CimSession on a remote endpoint
    and start a process usnig Invoke-CimMethod.

    This is a novel way to perform lateral movement or to start a remote process.

    This does require WinRM to be enabled. The account performing the run will also
    need to be elevated.

    A successful execution will stdout that the process started. On the remote endpoint,
    wmiprvse.exe will spawn the given process.
